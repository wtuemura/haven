Haven is an app for people needing a way to protect their private sphere
and possessions without compromising their own privacy.
It turns the on-device sensors of any Android phone into a motion, sound, vibration and
light detector, alerting you of unexpected guests and intruders in your physical spaces.
By combining monitoring and device storage, with secure communications technologies,
like Signal and Tor, it prevents the worst kind of people from silencing citizens
without getting caught in the act. By protecting investigative journalists,
human rights defenders, and people at risk of forced disappearance,
a new kind of herd immunity is created.

## Safety through Sensors

Haven only saves images and sound triggered by motion or volume,
storing everything locally on your device. Position the device’s camera
to capture visible motion, or place your phone somewhere discreet
to listen just for noises. Get secure notifications of intrusion events
instantly, and access logs remotely at any time.

Sensors monitored for measurable change, recorded to the device event log:

* Accelerometer: Motion and vibration of phone
* Camera: Motion in the phone’s visible surroundings from front or back camera
* Microphone: Noises in the environment
* Light sensor: Triggered by sudden light changes
* Power: Detect device being unplugged, running out of battery or being shut down

## Project Team

Haven is a collaboration between the Guardian project, and the
